# KOB Email Verification Service
##  Abstract
 *  KOB Email Verification Services proves the ownership of user over his email. It provides verified digital credential for user’s email which is stored in user’s wallet. User     submit this digital credential, when he provides his email for availing third party service.
 
##  Dependant Project
 *  This project is dependant on BCGOV's Email Verification Service.
 
##  Motivation
 *  Current email security solutions depend on various attributes to reduce the chances that a given email (mail) is likely to be a threat.current solutions make it relatively       easy to target corporate organizations with a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack. To overcome this problem a blockchain based ledger service marks down an outgoing mail.
 *  The advantages of this approach include:
     1. No separate setup is required (since it is a decentralized service).
     2. Since this is a blockchain based service, it is difficult to hack the data (100% safe regards to privacy).
     3. Decentralized since esa will act as the miners.
 *  Using this approach email details (e.g., sender, recipients, timestamp, etc.) are hashed and saved from any organization using email security gateways
 *  Any organization receiving the mail can check it for authenticity via the blockchain service, thus the mail cannot be spoofed.

##  Status Of The Project
 *  Incubation
 
## Solution
 *  This is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, proof-of-work, encrypted mail system that uses blockchain technology to conduct email verification.Decentralized Identifier or DIDs       refer to a system in which there is no common storage facility available. There might be many users who cannot setup and maintain DIDs themselves 
 *  This application can generate a lot of interest especially since spam mail has continued to circulate online, with some strategies linking the email to seemingly credible       sources.
